# sub_bub
Word macro for character substitution to beat plagarism software, just to see if I could.  
Usage:
1. Open the Word document you want the macro to be used in
2. Control+A to select all text you want changed
3. ALT+F11 to open VBA Editor 
3. Control+M to Import File: sub-bub.bas
4. F5 to run macro  
  
Congratulations, you have now character-substituted your document with similar-looking characters.  
  
  The characters substituted:  
     Original > new symbol  
      g > ɡ  
      o > ᴏ  
      c > ϲ  
      M > Μ  
      N > Ν  
      B > Β  
      A > Α  


Note: Plagiarise at your own risk. I don't condone plagiarising, nor do I plagiarise anything myself; that shit is wrong. Taking other peoples work without credit is seriously fucked up. Imagine someone did that to you. Plus, you don't really learn anything if you do. Plagiarisim is a serious thing.  





This was more of an exercise to see if I could, I don't think plagarising, or using this for getting past spam filters is a good thing.
